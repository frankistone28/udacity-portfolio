# Udacity Front End Web Developer
# Project 2 - Build a Portfolio Site

by Franklyn Thompson

**Result HTML page** can be found [here](https://frankistone28.github.io/udacity-portfolio/) in my github.io.

This portfolio is using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. It is a responsive web design so the layout will be adjusted according to the size of the web browser or screen. 

*Making the background image responsive is a bit difficult so I had to change the image at different viewports. I will update when I find the right solution.*
